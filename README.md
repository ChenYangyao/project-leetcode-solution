### What are we doing?

**Discussion:** Each day we determine which problem is to be solved, discuss the possible solution online, exchange good ideas.

**Coding:** We write code in different languages, use different algorithms, and for each algorithm we also try several implementations.

**Summary:** We compare the performance of algorithms (see figure below for an example), try to find possible extensions of the algorithm to other possible problems, and write short *discussion* for some interesting problems and algorithms.
